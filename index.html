            <p class="SPACEBAR">This website is for my subscribers, I am still learning how to use HTML.</p>
            <p class="NOOOOOOOO">You could support me by clicking on the ads that are showing here --->.</p> 
            <p class="SPACEBAR">I play on geometry dash a really fun game on mobile and computers, but you it is not free.</p>
            <p class="SPACEBAR">I also play on other games other than geometry dash, but I like geometry dash the most.</p> 
            <p class="NOOOOOOOO TAB">I like this game because it has other people's creations and I'm starting to make a feature worthy level. </p>
            <p class="SPACEBAR">This channel is family friendly and I also recomend you watching some of my videos but if you don't want to subscribe it's ok.</p> 
            <p class="SPACEBAR">I use Kinemaster to edit my videos because it's free and easy to use. I probably not upload videos daily, but I will definitely upload videos to my channel.</p>
            <p class="SPACEBAR">I don't know if I will be famous in the future, but I know I will have more subs than this after a very long time.</p>
            <p class="SPACEBAR">If you don't know what and how this game works I will explain through wikipedia</p>
            <p class="NOOOOOOOO">Geometry Dash uses a simple tapping/clicking system to control different vehicles that react when a player presses anywhere on the touchscreen 
                (space/up key(s), mouse, or "A" button when using a controller if playing on the PC version) and can be held down to constantly interact (on some vehicles).
                 Users cannot control the speed at which the icon is moving, the only way to change speed is by touching a speed changing arrow set.
                 The timing and rhythm of the in-game music are key parts of the game, often in relation to each other.
                The objective of the game is to complete a level by reaching its end;
                 however, if the player crashes into an obstacle, they will have to start over from the beginning. All levels (with the exception of the three "demon" rated levels in the full version) are unlocked from the start,
                  so they can be played out of order. Along the way, the player can collect up to three secret coins in each official level, which are scattered in either hidden or challenging areas (or both).</p>
