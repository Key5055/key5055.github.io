            <p class="SPACEBAR">Geometry Dash uses a simple tapping/clicking system to control different vehicles that react when a player presses anywhere on the touchscreen

            <P class="SPACEBAR">Users cannot control the speed at which the icon is moving, the only way to change speed is by touching a speed changing arrow set.
                The timing and rhythm of the in-game music are key parts of the game, often in relation to each other.
               The objective of the game is to complete a level by reaching its end;

            <p class="SPACEBAR">levels (with the exception of the three "demon" rated levels in the full version) are unlocked from the start,
                 so they can be played out of order. Along the way, the player can collect up to three secret coins in each official level, which are scattered in either hidden or challenging areas (or both).(space/up key(s),
